# Project 1: Sorting and Searching Algorithms

- **Summary:** Implement basic sorting (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort) and searching algorithms (e.g., binary search). Analyze their time complexity.
- **Technology:** C++
- **Focus:** Understanding fundamental algorithms, time complexity, and basic data structures like arrays and lists.

## Overview:

- **Objective:** Implement and compare various sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) and searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search).
- **Key Concepts:** Time complexity, recursion, and divide-and-conquer strategies.

### Steps to Start:

1. **Learn the Basics:** Review the basics of sorting and searching algorithms, including their time and space complexities.
2. **Set Up Development Environment:** Install a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or MSVC) and set up your development environment (e.g., VSCode, CLion).
3. **Write the Algorithms:** Start by writing simple sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. Gradually move on to more complex ones like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
4. **Test Your Code:** Write a main function that inputs an array, sorts it using different algorithms, and compares their performance.
5. **Optimization:** Explore how you can optimize these algorithms, e.g., implementing an optimized version of Bubble Sort.
