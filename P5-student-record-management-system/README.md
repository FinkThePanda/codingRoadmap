# Project 5: Student Record Management System

- **Summary:** Develop a simple database system to store, retrieve, update, and delete student records using SQL queries.
- **Technology:** C++, SQL
- **Focus:** Introduction to databases, SQL syntax, and integration of C++ with SQL databases (e.g., SQLite).

## Overview

- **Objective:** Create a basic system to manage student records, including storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.
- **Key Concepts:** SQL queries, database design, and C++-SQL integration.

## Steps to Start

1. **Learn SQL Basics:** Familiarize yourself with SQL, particularly commands for creating tables, inserting data, and querying data.
2. **Set Up a Database:** Use SQLite for simplicity. Set up a database with a table for student records (e.g., `students` with columns like `id`, `name`, `grade`).
3. **Database Integration in C++:** Use a library like SQLiteCpp to connect your C++ application to the SQLite database.
4. **CRUD Operations:** Implement functions in C++ for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the student records.
5. **User Interface:** Create a simple text-based interface that allows users to perform these operations via command line.
