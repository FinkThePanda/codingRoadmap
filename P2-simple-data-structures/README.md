# Project 2: Simple Data Structures

- **Summary:** Implement data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables.
- **Technology:** C++
- **Focus:** Gain familiarity with pointer manipulation, memory management, and the use of classes in C++.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Implement fundamental data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Hash Tables.
- **Key Concepts:** Pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and basic object-oriented programming.

## Steps to Start

1. **Understand Data Structures:** Study how linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables work, focusing on their structure and operations.
2. **Start with Linked List:** Begin by implementing a singly linked list. Create operations like insert, delete, and traverse.
3. **Move to Stacks and Queues:** Once comfortable with linked lists, implement stacks and queues, both using arrays and linked lists.
4. **Implement Hash Table:** Implement a simple hash table with open addressing or separate chaining to handle collisions.
5. **Test and Debug:** Write a series of tests in your main function to ensure all data structures behave as expected.
