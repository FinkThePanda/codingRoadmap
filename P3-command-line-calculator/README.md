# Project 3: Command-Line Calculator

- **Summary:** Create a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations, with support for parentheses and operator precedence.
- **Technology:** C++
- **Focus:** Parsing algorithms, stack usage, and command-line interfaces.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Build a calculator that can handle basic arithmetic operations and respect operator precedence.
- **Key Concepts:** Parsing, stack-based evaluation, and command-line interface design.

## Steps to Start

1. **Understand Expression Parsing:** Learn how to parse mathematical expressions and convert them to postfix notation using the Shunting Yard algorithm.
2. **Stack Implementation:** Use a stack to evaluate the postfix expression.
3. **Build the Calculator:** Combine your parsing and stack code to build the calculator.
4. **Enhance Features:** Consider adding features like handling parentheses, floating-point operations, and error handling.
5. **Testing:** Create various test cases to ensure the calculator handles all edge cases correctly.
