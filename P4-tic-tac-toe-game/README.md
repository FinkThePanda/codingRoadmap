# Project 4: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

- **Summary:** Build a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can play against each other on the command line.
- **Technology:** C++
- **Focus:** Game logic, state management, and user interaction in the terminal.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Develop a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players.
- **Key Concepts:** Game loops, state management, and user interaction.

## Steps to Start

1. **Plan the Game Logic:** Define the game board as a 2D array and outline the rules for checking win conditions, draws, and valid moves.
2. **Set Up the Board:** Write a function to display the game board and update it based on player input.
3. **Player Input:** Implement input handling to take turns between two players.
4. **Game Loop:** Develop the game loop that repeatedly asks for player input, updates the board, and checks for a win or draw condition.
5. **Enhancements:** Add features like input validation and a computer opponent with basic AI.
